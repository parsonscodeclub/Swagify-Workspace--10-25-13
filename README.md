## Chrome

Get it here: https://www.google.com/chrome

You don't *have* to use Chrome, but we like it, and its extensions make your workflow so much better.

### Chrome Extensions
1. [JSON Formatter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en)
2. [WhatFont](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/whatfont/jabopobgcpjmedljpbcaablpmlmfcogm?hl=en)
3. [LiveReload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en), we'll talk about that in a bit.

### Web Developer Tools

You can do some cool stuff with Chrome's Web Inspector!
*   check CSS syntax
*   adjust values with up and down arrows
*   check CSS :hover and :active states
*   inspect network requests and responses
*   change color units

And in the near future, it'll have even more features:
*   inspection of canvas drawings
*   pseudo-elements

## LiveReload

LiveReload lets you work on your web projects without having to constantly refresh the browser, by refreshing the browser for you whenever one of your files change.

It works with a number of css preprocessors (sass, less, stylus) as well as html preprocessors (haml, markdown) - to name a few.
