2. WhatFont
3. LiveReload, we'll talk about that in a bit

### Web Developer Tools



## LiveReload

LiveReload lets you work on your web projects without having to constantly refresh the browser, by refreshing the browser for you whenever one of your files change.

It works with a number of css preprocessors (sass, less, stylus) as well as html preprocessors (haml, markdown) - to name a few.

1. [Alfred](http://alfredapp.com), the best app ever (free, but $25 for extra features)
2. Frank DeLoupe, a color picker ($1)
3. Divvy, a window manager ($14)
